# Cinematic Sentiments: RNN vs LSTM
**Abstract:** This project applies deep learning for sentiment analysis using the IMDB movie reviews dataset. We compare a simple RNN and an LSTM model, both built and trained directly using Keras' high-level API. Reviews are preprocessed through tokenization and padding, and hyperparameters are tuned with Keras Tuner. Evaluation using accuracy, recall, AUC, and ROC curves shows strong performance, especially with LSTM. The study highlights the practical use of Keras for fast prototyping in NLP tasks.
